# AIoD Metadata Model
The repository hosts and maintains material related to the AIoD Metadata Model and its formal specification.

The purpose of the AIoD metadata model is to sufficiently define the different entities relevant to the European AI ecosystem that will allow the coverage of those requirements. This entails the incorporation of conceptualisations for various ecosystem aspects: informational, technical, networking, and educational. Furthermore, the model aims to facilitate interoperability with widely used models and external platforms that should be easily connectable to the AIoD platform.

To serve the aforementioned objectives, the metadata model defines a structured hierarchy of *AIoD Concepts*. The notion of AIoD Concept entails *AIResources*, which is analysed in, firstly, *AI Assets*, an abstraction for different types of technical and informational assets accessible and usable from the interested audiences; and secondly, other *Ecosystem Resources* that are not assets per se, but are closely related to them and can be sources of information or guidance (e.g., people and institutions, projects and networks, etc.). Lastly, the model includes concepts that are not directly related to AI but are required to provide further context for assets and resources, like locations, constructs to model the size of an asset, etc.

Detailed documentation for the entities included in the model and their respective properties can be found through the relevant [GitHub site](https://aiondemand.github.io/metadata-schema/). You can also use a dynamic visualisation of the model via the relevant [feature](https://aiondemand.github.io/metadata-schema/doc/webvowl/index.html#).
